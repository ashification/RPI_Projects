# RPI_Projects

This repository serves as examples for code to be used in Raspberry Pi projects.
## Raspberry Pi 
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a mini computer produced by Raspberry Pi. <br/>
You can read more specific details about the device  here: [RPI Official Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) <br/>
For versioning and compatability please note this was all developed accross several Raspberry pi modesl and versions of Raspbian<br/><br/>

## The mini projects are:
- Example 1 - 
- Example 2 - 


## The Major Project - The Demo Box
The Demo box code is my personal development for testing out new features to add to the above examples list and demonstrating new features.


## Integrations
I am integrating the above code with a Mosquitto MQTT broker and a web based dashboard using NodeRed all hosted on my Raspberry Pi 5.<br/><br/> 

### Installers
The code for setting up both can be found in my [raspberry pi base installers script](https://github.com/ashification/RPISetup/blob/main/Installers/rpi_base_installer.sh) under the followng headings:
- "# Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker"
- "## Installing nodeRed"
<br/>

### Dashboard
If youre looking for help/examples for building your workflows/configuring your NodeRed dashboards <br/>
you can jump over to [raspberry pi base installers script](https://github.com/ashification/NodeRedProjects) for a few examples
